# Data Exploration
- Basic Expolaration: Class imbalance, find missing values, 
- Visualize Data distributions
- Investigate feature correlations (plot pair-wise corrolation and corrolation heatmap)
- Feature analysis to understand which features are more important, which features convey less information, and which features require clarification
- Explore feature selection: Gini Importance, chi2
- Outliers Detection

# Supervised Learning
- Pre-processed data for classification (shuffle, split, feature normalization)
- Knn, SVM, random forest
- Hyperparameter tunig through grid search
