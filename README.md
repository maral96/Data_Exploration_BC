Exploration of breast cancer dataset, utalizing feature engineering techniques and supervised learning methods to predict malignancy.

# Data Exploration
- Basic Expolaration: class imbalance, find missing values, etc.
- Visualize Data Distributions
- Investigate Feature Correlations (plot pair-wise corrolation and corrolation heatmap)
- Feature analysis to understand which features are more important, which features convey less information, and which features require clarification
- Explore Feature Selection methods: Gini Importance, chi2
- Outliers Detection

# Supervised Learning
- Pre-processed data for classification (shuffle, split, feature normalization)
- Knn, SVM, random forest
- Hyperparameter tunig through grid search
